## 🎓 .EDU Domain - Requirements & Reality Check

### Can You Bet Your Azure Get a .edu Domain?

**Short Answer:** Not immediately—.edu domains require accreditation.

**Requirements (from EDUCAUSE):**
1. **Must be accredited** by an agency recognized by U.S. Department of Education
2. **Must be degree-granting** institution (Associates, Bachelors, Masters, etc.)
3. **Must be physically located** in the United States

**Options to Eventually Get .edu:**

#### Option 1: Partner with Accredited School
- Partner with community college or university
- They host You Bet Your Azure curriculum under their .edu domain
- Example: `youbetyourazure.stlcc.edu` (if St. Louis Community College partnership)

#### Option 2: Pursue Accreditation (Long-Term)
- Apply for accreditation from DETC (Distance Education Accrediting Commission)
- Requires 2+ years of operation, student outcomes data, curriculum review
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years minimum
- **Cost:** $50,000-$100,000+ (accreditation is expensive)

#### Option 3: Use Alternative Domains (Recommended for Now)
- ✅ **youbetyourazure.com** (current - keep this!)
- ✅ **youbetyourazure.org** (register this - .org for nonprofits)
- ✅ **youbetyourazure.io** (tech-friendly domain)
- ❌ **youbetyourazure.edu** (not available without accreditation)

**Bottom Line:** Focus on .com and .org for now. Pursue .edu later if you achieve accreditation through partnerships.
