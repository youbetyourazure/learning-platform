## Subject: Request for Educational Partnership - Azure Certification Curriculum with Healthcare Focus

Dear Microsoft Education Team,

I am writing to introduce **You Bet Your Azure**, a non-profit educational initiative that teaches Azure cloud development through real-world healthcare applications, and to explore opportunities for Microsoft partnership, certification alignment, and potential sponsorship.

### Mission Statement

**You Bet Your Azure** provides free, open-source, production-grade education for aspiring Azure developers. Our curriculum bridges the gap between academic theory and industry practice by teaching Azure services through a live healthcare application serving 5,000+ users.

**Platform:** https://youbetyourazure.com  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/youbetyourazure/learning-platform  
**Target Audience:** Career changers, bootcamp graduates, community college students, veterans transitioning to tech

### Why This Matters for Microsoft

1. **Azure Certification Pipeline**: Our curriculum directly prepares students for AZ-204 (Azure Developer), AZ-104 (Azure Administrator), and DP-203 (Data Engineering)

2. **Healthcare Vertical**: Healthcare is one of Azure's fastest-growing sectors. We teach Azure in the context of HIPAA compliance, patient data security, and EHR integration.

3. **Diversity & Access**: Free education model removes financial barriers. We're targeting underserved communities and first-generation college students.

4. **Production Code**: Unlike most tutorials, we teach with real code from a live application—not toy examples. This builds job-ready skills.

5. **Power BI Integration**: Module 3 teaches Azure + Power BI with Census Bureau API integration for geographic healthcare analytics.

## Closing Thoughts

Microsoft has always championed accessible education and workforce development. You Bet Your Azure embodies those values—free, open-source, production-grade learning for anyone with internet access.

With Microsoft's support, we can scale this from a solo project to a recognized certification pathway, creating hundreds of Azure-certified healthcare developers who will build the next generation of Azure solutions.

I strongly believe this partnership would showcase Microsoft's commitment to education, diversity in tech, and healthcare innovation. Let's make Azure education accessible to everyone—**you bet your Azure on it**.

Respectfully,

**P.S.** - Our Census API + Power BI integration is entirely unique in the education space. Students learn to fetch 42 demographic variables, map hospital catchment areas, and create Venn diagrams comparing "Census potential vs. patients served." This is not taught in any bootcamp or university program—it's a Microsoft opportunity to own this niche in healthcare analytics education.
