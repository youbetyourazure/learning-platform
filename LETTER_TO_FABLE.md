## Subject: Educational Partnership Opportunity - Power BI & Healthcare Analytics

Dear Fable Team,

I am writing to propose a mutually beneficial educational partnership between **You Bet Your Azure** and **Fable** that combines our shared passion for data analytics, healthcare innovation, and workforce development.

### About You Bet Your Azure

You Bet Your Azure is an emerging non-profit educational platform dedicated to teaching enterprise-grade Azure development, Power BI analytics, and healthcare informatics through real-world production code. Our curriculum is built on a live healthcare application serving 5,000+ users (Grace & Company LLC's transitional care system).

**Platform Highlights:**
- 40+ hours of comprehensive Django/Azure curriculum
- Production code from real healthcare applications
- Census API integration for "Know Your Patients, Know Your Neighborhood" analytics
- Power BI dashboards with geographic catchment area visualizations
- Microsoft Learn-style education, freely accessible
- Currently available at: https://youbetyourazure.com

### Why Partner with Fable?

During our Power BI consultation sessions, I've been impressed by Fable's commitment to excellence in business intelligence and data storytelling. Our educational platform emphasizes these same principles, particularly:

1. **Census API Integration** - Teaching students to connect external APIs to Power BI
2. **Geographic Analytics** - Hospital catchment areas, Venn diagram demographic overlaps
3. **DAX Formulas & Calculated Columns** - Healthcare metrics and KPI tracking
4. **Real-World Data Modeling** - Patient demographics, provider networks, facility analytics

### Proposed Partnership Models

**Option 1: Curriculum Co-Development**
- Fable contributes Power BI best practices to Module 3 (Census Geographic Analytics)
- Your team reviews and validates our Power BI curriculum for industry accuracy
- Co-branded "Powered by Fable" designation on Power BI-focused lessons
- Fable gains brand visibility among emerging data analysts

**Option 2: Internship/Talent Pipeline**
- Students completing our Power BI modules become pre-qualified for Fable internships
- You Bet Your Azure becomes a talent pipeline for entry-level BI analysts
- Fable provides mentorship hours or guest lectures
- Win-win: Students gain job pathways, Fable gains trained candidates

**Option 3: Sponsored Content**
- Fable sponsors video production for Module 3 (Power BI focus)
- Video tutorials feature Fable case studies and methodologies
- Tax-deductible sponsorship once our 501(c)(3) non-profit status is approved
- Budget: $5,000-$10,000 for professional video production (6 lessons)

**Option 4: Joint Webinar Series**
- Quarterly webinars: "From Census Data to Power BI Dashboards"
- Fable presenters walk through real client projects (anonymized)
- Students learn industry workflows and best practices
- Fable builds brand authority in healthcare analytics space

### What We Bring to the Table

- **Production-Grade Curriculum**: Not toy examples—real code serving real users
- **Healthcare Vertical Expertise**: Deep knowledge of hospital operations, discharge planning, SNF analytics
- **Census Bureau API Integration**: Unique niche—few competitors teach this
- **Geographic Visualizations**: Bubble maps, choropleths, Venn diagrams for service area analysis
- **Growing Student Base**: Initial outreach to Christian Brothers College High School (CBCHS) alumni network

### Next Steps

I would love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how Fable's Power BI expertise could enhance our curriculum while providing your team with brand visibility and talent pipeline benefits.

**Proposed Agenda:**
1. Demo of youbetyourazure.com platform (10 min)
2. Walk through Module 3: Census Geographic Analytics (10 min)
3. Discuss partnership options that align with Fable's goals (5 min)
4. Q&A and next steps (5 min)

## Why This Matters

The healthcare analytics workforce is growing rapidly, but most college programs teach theory, not production skills. By partnering with You Bet Your Azure, Fable can:

✅ Shape the next generation of Power BI analysts  
✅ Build brand authority in healthcare BI  
✅ Create a qualified talent pipeline  
✅ Contribute to workforce development (ESG/CSR goals)  
✅ Gain tax benefits through non-profit sponsorship  

I look forward to exploring how we can collaborate to educate tomorrow's data analysts today.

Respectfully,

- Platform overview (README.md)
- Sample Module 3 curriculum (Census Geographic Analytics)
- Power BI dashboard examples from Grace & Company

**P.S.** - Our Census API integration is particularly unique. Students learn to fetch 42 demographic variables, aggregate multi-ZIP catchment areas, and visualize "Who's missing?" (Census potential vs. patients served). This is not taught anywhere else—it's a Fable opportunity to own this niche.
