**What you'll learn (for FREE):**
✅ Build websites and apps (Django/Python)  
✅ Work with cloud computing (Microsoft Azure)  
✅ Create data dashboards (Power BI - perfect if you love spreadsheets!)  
✅ Use AI tools to automate boring tasks  

**Jobs you could qualify for:**
- Healthcare IT Specialist ($70K-$95K)
- Data Analyst ($60K-$85K)
- Cloud Administrator ($75K-$100K)
- Junior Developer ($65K-$90K)

**Start part-time. Learn at your pace. No pressure.**

Finish one module, feel proud. Finish three, update your resume. Finish all six, apply for jobs.

The hardest part? Starting. The easiest part? It's completely free.
