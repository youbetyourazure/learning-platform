## Subject: Alumni Proposal - Free Cloud Computing & Healthcare IT Curriculum for CBCHS Students

Dear CBCHS Leadership and Computer Science Faculty,

As a proud alumnus of Christian Brothers College High School, I am writing to give back to the institution that shaped my career by offering CBCHS students free access to a professional-grade Azure cloud computing and healthcare IT curriculum.

### Introduction: From CBCHS to Healthcare IT

I graduated from CBCHS in [Your Year], and the education I received—particularly the Lasallian values of service, faith, and community—inspired me to create **You Bet Your Azure**, a non-profit educational platform teaching real-world cloud development skills through healthcare applications.

**Platform:** https://youbetyourazure.com  
**Mission:** Make enterprise-grade Azure education accessible to all students, regardless of economic background

### What You Bet Your Azure Offers CBCHS

**You Bet Your Azure** is a comprehensive, free, open-source learning platform that teaches:

1. **Django Web Development** (Python framework)
2. **Microsoft Azure Cloud Services** (App Service, PostgreSQL, AI)
3. **Power BI Data Analytics** (Healthcare dashboards, Census API integration)
4. **Healthcare Informatics** (HIPAA, EHR, patient data privacy)
5. **Geographic Analytics** ("Know Your Patients, Know Your Neighborhood")

**Curriculum Highlights:**
- ✅ 40+ hours of comprehensive content
- ✅ Production code from real healthcare application (5,000+ users)
- ✅ Aligned to Microsoft Azure certifications (AZ-204, AZ-104, PL-300)
- ✅ Video tutorials (YouTube series in production)
- ✅ Free and accessible—no cost to students or school
- ✅ Self-paced learning with optional mentorship

### Why This Matters for CBCHS

#### **1. Computer Science Elective or Club**
CBCHS could integrate You Bet Your Azure as:
- **Senior elective**: "Healthcare IT & Cloud Computing"
- **Computer Science Club**: Hands-on Azure projects
- **Independent study**: College-level curriculum for advanced students

#### **2. College & Career Readiness**
Students completing our curriculum will:
- Enter college with production-grade coding experience
- Qualify for Azure certifications (competitive on college applications)
- Stand out in computer science admissions (real portfolio projects)
- Be prepared for healthcare IT internships (high-demand field)

#### **3. Lasallian Mission Alignment**
Healthcare IT directly serves the vulnerable—patients in transitional care, elderly populations, underserved communities. Our curriculum teaches:
- How technology improves patient outcomes
- Using Census data to identify gaps in healthcare access
- Building systems that serve "the last, the lost, and the least"

**This is STEM education in service of others—perfect for CBCHS's Lasallian values.**

#### **4. No Cost, No Strings Attached**
- ✅ **Free curriculum** - no software licenses, no subscriptions
- ✅ **Free Azure credits** - Microsoft provides student accounts
- ✅ **Free mentorship** - I will personally hold office hours (virtual or in-person)
- ✅ **No vendor lock-in** - Open-source code, students own their work

### Proposed Implementation Models

#### **Option 1: Computer Science Class Integration**
- CBCHS Computer Science teacher integrates 1-2 modules into existing coursework
- Students build a Django web app as semester project
- I provide virtual guest lectures and Q&A sessions

#### **Option 2: After-School Club / Coding Club**
- Weekly meetings: Students work through modules together
- I mentor remotely or visit quarterly (I'm in [Your Location])
- Culminates in deployed Azure portfolio project

#### **Option 3: Summer Intensive Program**
- 2-week intensive: Students complete Modules 1-3
- Hybrid format: Video lessons + live coding sessions
- Students leave with Azure-deployed web application for college applications

#### **Option 4: Independent Study for Advanced Students**
- Juniors/Seniors with programming experience take self-paced curriculum
- Counts as Computer Science elective credit
- I serve as remote mentor/advisor

### What I'm Offering CBCHS (Free)

✅ **Full curriculum access** for all CBCHS students  
✅ **Video tutorials** (YouTube series launching Q2 2026)  
✅ **Quarterly guest lectures** (virtual or in-person)  
✅ **Office hours** (monthly Zoom sessions for Q&A)  
✅ **Portfolio project guidance** (help students showcase for college apps)  
✅ **Letter of recommendation** for students completing all modules  
✅ **Azure certification prep** (voucher assistance once non-profit status approved)

### Success Stories We're Building

**Target Student Outcomes:**
- Student deploys Django healthcare app to Azure App Service
- Student builds Power BI dashboard with Census demographic data
- Student earns Azure certification before college graduation
- Student uses portfolio project in college admissions essays
- Student lands healthcare IT internship at BJC, SSM Health, Mercy

**CBCHS Wins:**
- Enhanced STEM curriculum with real-world applications
- College placement success stories
- Alumni engagement and giving back
- Lasallian mission in action (healthcare IT for patient care)

### Why Healthcare IT?

Healthcare IT is one of the fastest-growing career fields:
- 📈 **15% job growth** (2024-2034, Bureau of Labor Statistics)
- 💰 **$95,000+ median salary** for healthcare software developers
- 🏥 **High demand** in St. Louis: BJC HealthCare, SSM Health, Mercy
- 🎓 **College major pathway**: Computer Science, Health Informatics, Data Science

CBCHS students learning Healthcare IT + Azure will have a competitive edge in both college admissions and job markets.

### Logistics & Support

**What CBCHS Needs to Provide:**
- Computer lab or student laptop access (standard setup)
- 1 faculty sponsor (Computer Science teacher or club advisor)
- 1-2 hours/week during school or after-school

**What I Will Provide:**
- All curriculum materials (free website access)
- Virtual mentorship and guest lectures
- Technical support (email, Zoom office hours)
- Certificate of completion for students finishing modules

**Timeline:**
- **March 2026**: Initial meeting with CBCHS CS Department
- **April 2026**: Pilot program with 5-10 interested students
- **Fall 2026**: Full rollout as elective or club

### Personal Connection: Why I'm Doing This

CBCHS taught me the values of service, integrity, and excellence. My career in healthcare IT—building systems for Grace & Company, hospital discharge planning, and patient care coordination—is a direct result of those values.

**You Bet Your Azure** is my way of giving back. I want CBCHS students to:
- See that computer science can serve others (not just tech companies)
- Graduate with marketable skills (not just theory)
- Enter college ahead of their peers
- Build portfolios that demonstrate real-world impact

**Healthcare IT is where faith and technology intersect—and CBCHS students are perfectly positioned to lead in this field.**

## Closing Thoughts

Christian Brothers College High School gave me an education rooted in service. Now, I'm offering CBCHS students the tools to serve patients, hospitals, and communities through healthcare IT.

**This is Lasallian education in action: faith, service, and community—powered by Azure.**

I look forward to partnering with CBCHS to make this happen. Let's give our students the real-world skills they need to build a career serving others.
